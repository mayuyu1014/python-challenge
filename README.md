# python-challenge
In Pybank challenge, I used two lists to store the data from the csv file. One list is the dates, the other is the values. I loop through the value list to find out the average changes, max increase and max decrease
Then I zip these two list together to find out the corresponding months.
The final analysis is stored in a txt file

in Pypoll challenge, I simply loop through the csv to get the result, a simple function is used to make the codes cleaner
And the final analysis is stored in a txt file
